## Sprint Logs

All implementation work is tracked in numbered sprint notes. Each sprint log uses the following structure:

1. **Sprint Goals** – bullet list describing what we plan to achieve.
2. **Tasks & Outputs** – concise notes for every code/content change, referencing files when useful.
3. **Validation** – any tests, linters, or manual checks executed (or why they were skipped).
4. **Follow-ups** – items that should roll into the next sprint.

Create new entries as `sprint-XX.md` (zero-padded) so they remain ordered. Use UTC dates in the headers.
